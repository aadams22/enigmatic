#Enigmatic

##Overview
Enigmatic is an encrypted private messaging web application that allows the user to privately message their friends with visual privacy. Both Facebook login and local authentication is required for login. User is able to message their friends and the message shows up as encrypted on the front-end. To decode the message, the user only needs to hover over the message. On off hover the message is immediately replaced with the encrypted version and the decrypted version is deleted from the front-end. Messages are saved as encrypted and past messages repopulate the messaging field when the user clicks previous user.
